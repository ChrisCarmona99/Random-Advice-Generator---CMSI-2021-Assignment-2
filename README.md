# Random-Advice-Generator---CMSI-2021-Assignment-2

This repository contains all of the project files for our Random Advice Generator Web Application, an app that takes in a single word and queries some advice based off that word. We developed the entire application in React.js, and utilized the Advice Slip JSON API to handle all of our advice queries; link to the API: https://api.adviceslip.com/. We chose this API because we thought it would be a fun way to get practice working with API's in React, along with give us an avenue to incorporate intersting designs for our app.
